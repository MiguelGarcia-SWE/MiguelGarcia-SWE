## About me 🤩

I'm currently diving deeper into graphics programming, tools, and game engines, with a focus on learning how systems 
work at a lower level.
So I'm exploring the workings of OpenGL, GLSL, OpenCV, Raylib, and APIs like Vulkan and DirectX!

I’m passionate about PC building, game development, robotics, and always expanding my technical skill set through hands-on projects and experimentation.
